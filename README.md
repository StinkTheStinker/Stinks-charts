Stinks charts
---------------------------------------------------
# Hello, this is charts that stinko makes! This only uses JS Engine because it's good. Note that it will have a bit of modified setting to it.

# List of Currently Charted songs:
Cheating 3.5 (MoldyGH)
 Unfairness 3.5 (MoldyGH)

# This is usualy made in high effort.

# Credits:

----- JS Engine -----

Jordan Santiago - Making JS Engine

Stinko - Modifying it a bit, just for this mod

----- Songs -----

MoldyGH - Dave and Bambi

----- Coding -----

Stinko - small amount of coding on Haxe, most coding on lua.

----- Help on the mod -----

Jordan Santiago - Helping me on a couple things (i ask him a question, quick note). 

----- Renders the songs -----
Jordan Santiago - Not rendered the charts yet, but possibly will soon.
 - Reason why is because some shaders like the "BlockedGlitchEffect" breaks the game for low end computers, even though that it works fine on Dave and Bambi






# Where the songs came from
Dave and Bambi 3.5 - Unfairness, and Cheating
